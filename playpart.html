        <h3>1st Citizen (meeting another).</h3> <p>Hullo, Lamstad! You here too?</p>
        <h3>2nd Citizen.</h3> <p>I go to every public meeting, I do.</p>
        <h3>3rd Citizen.</h3> <p>Brought your whistle too, I expect!</p>
        <h3>2nd Citizen.</h3> <p>I should think so. Haven't you?</p>
        <h3>3rd Citizen.</h3> <p>Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
        cow-horn, he did.</p>
        <h3>2nd Citizen.</h3> <p>Good old Evensen! (Laughter among the crowd.)</p>
