        <b>1st Citizen (meeting another).</b> <br>Hullo, Lamstad! You here too?<br><br>

        <b>2nd Citizen.</b> <br>I go to every public meeting, I do.<br><br>

        <b>3rd Citizen.</b> <br>Brought your whistle too, I expect!<br><br>

        <b>2nd Citizen.</b> <br>I should think so. Haven't you?<br><br>

        <b>3rd Citizen.</b> <br>Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
        cow-horn, he did.<br><br>

        <b>2nd Citizen.</b> <br>Good old Evensen! (Laughter among the crowd.)<br><br>
